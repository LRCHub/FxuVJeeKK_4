Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this and I love you right back

뛰는 심장 소릴 따라가
커지는 울림, oh my, oh my God
Oh yeah, let me hear you say "Yeah" (uh-uh-uh)
숨겨놨던 맘속 deep blue sea
꺼내 펼쳐봐 느껴지는 feels
Oh yeah, don't run away, yeah (now, now)

철로 만든 heart, 예쁜 꽃을 피워봐
사막 속에 비를 내려봐 (uh-uh)
If you wanna be my lover, 닫힌 맘을 다 깨뜨려
If you wanna, wanna, wanna-wanna-wanna

Show me your way
어느 틈에 자라난 이끌림
점을 이어, oh baby
맘속 fireworks (woo), 외쳐 higher hopes
눈을 맞춰, it's so easy, you just gotta

Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this and I love you right back (right back)

Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this and I love you right back

Oh, 큰 파도가 시작될 걸 (ride now)
Buckle up, ready, set, go (let's go!)
이 감정의 폭을 explore

조금 더 거침없이, 빠져 이 fever
그 순간 가슴속에, 넘쳐난 flower
이미 움트고 있던 숨
고장 난 네 맘속의 bloom, oh

Show me your way
어느 틈에 연결된 piece of love (oh-oh)
선을 따라가 baby
번진 fireworks, 펼친 higher hopes
손을 뻗어, it's so easy, you just gotta

Love me like this (hey), love me like that (hey)
Love me like this, love me like that (love me)
Love me like this, love me like that (yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Love me like this and I love you right back (and I'll love you right back)

Love me like this (yuh), love me like that (woo)
Love me like this (oh, love), love me like that
Love me like this (love me), love me like that
Love me like this and I love you right back (yeah)

Can you see the paradise?
감각들을 깨워봐
끝내 찾은 missing piece
심장 속을 밝힌 peace
나를 향해 켜진 love
결국 너를 향할 love
너와 내 꿈이 이어져 커져갈 time (love me like this, love me like that)

Love me like this (hey), love me like that
Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this and I love you right back

Love me like this (yo), love me like that (ayo)
Love me like this (oh), love me like that (oh)
Love me like this (love me), love me like that (love me)
Love me like this and I love you right back

Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this, love me like that
Love me like this and I love you right back
